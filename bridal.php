<h2>Bridal</h2>

<p>We all know that every bride-to-be wants to look the finest on her big day.
But to do so.we  prepare you for your big day.First thing’s first, most of us have skin and hair issues. Prepping involves fixing these issues and then smoothly transitioning to makeup without risking the health of your hair or skin. On the other hand, makeup and styling without prepping would be a poor masking attempt and may result in a flawed look.

Ideally, pre-bridal prep should be done couple of months prior to the wedding.
